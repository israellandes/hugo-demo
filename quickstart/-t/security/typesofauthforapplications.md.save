This article is about the diffrent types of security standards used for logging into applications

<hr>

## Security Login Standards

The three main standards I will focus this article on are:
1. HTTP Basic Auth - **Least secure**
2. OAuth - **More secure**
3. SAML - **Most secure**

## HTTP Bassic Authentication

This method is fairly easy to implement on web servers like Apache & Nginx that serve webite content in a variety of diffrent formats and languages, the main being HTML and PHP.
